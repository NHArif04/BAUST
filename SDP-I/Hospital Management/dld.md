Certainly, here are the complete differences:

1. **Flip-Flops vs. Latches:**
   - **Flip-Flops:**
     - Flip-flops are clocked or synchronous devices.
     - They are edge-triggered, responding to a specific edge (rising or falling) of a clock signal.
     - Flip-flops store one bit of data (0 or 1) and are used for sequential circuits.
     - Common types include D flip-flops, JK flip-flops, T flip-flops, and RS flip-flops.

   - **Latches:**
     - Latches are not strictly clocked; they are asynchronous devices.
     - Latches are level-triggered, changing their output as long as the input level is maintained and the enable signal allows.
     - They also store one bit of data and are used for simpler storage elements.
     - Common types include SR (Set-Reset) latches and D (Data) latches.

2. **Sequential vs. Combinational Circuits:**
   - **Sequential Circuits:**
     - Sequential circuits have memory elements, such as flip-flops.
     - They depend on both the current inputs and the previous state (stored in memory) to determine the output.
     - Common examples include counters, registers, and state machines.

   - **Combinational Circuits:**
     - Combinational circuits have no memory elements.
     - They generate output solely based on the current input values, with no regard for previous inputs or states.
     - Examples include logic gates, multiplexers, and adders.

3. **Level-Triggered vs. Edge-Triggered:**
   - **Level-Triggered Circuits:**
     - These circuits respond to and change based on continuous input levels.
     - The output can change as long as the input maintains a particular logic level (high or low).
     - Commonly associated with latches.

   - **Edge-Triggered Circuits:**
     - Edge-triggered circuits respond to specific transitions in a clock signal.
     - The output changes only at the rising or falling edge of the clock signal.
     - Commonly associated with flip-flops.

4. **Flip-Flop Types:**
   - **D Flip-Flops:**
     - Have a single data input (D).
     - Store the value at the D input on the active clock edge.

   - **JK Flip-Flops:**
     - Have two inputs (J and K) for more functionality.
     - Can function as toggling flip-flops or data storage elements.

   - **T Flip-Flops:**
     - Have a single input (T) that toggles the state on each clock edge.

   - **RS Flip-Flops:**
     - Have two inputs (S and R) for setting and resetting the state.

Each of these differences highlights the key distinctions between these concepts in digital electronics.
