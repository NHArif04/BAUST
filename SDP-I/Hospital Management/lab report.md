# Objectives:

1. To develop a Hospital Management System in C++.
2. To create a system for managing patient records, appointments, and medical records.
3. To implement user registration and authentication functionality.
4. To use object-oriented programming concepts in C++ to design and implement the system.

# Introduction:

The Hospital Management System is designed to assist healthcare institutions in managing patient information, appointments, and medical records. This system offers user registration and authentication features to ensure data security and privacy. The project is implemented in C++ and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes and objects.

# Description:

### User Authentication:

- Explanation: The system provides user registration and authentication to ensure data security.
- Relevance: It ensures that only authorized users can access and modify patient data.
- Examples: User registration and login functions in the code.

### Patient Management:

- Explanation: The system allows the addition of patient information, modification of patient details, and the generation of patient reports.
- Relevance: This functionality helps in maintaining and updating patient records efficiently.
- Examples: Functions for adding, modifying, and generating patient reports.

### Appointment Scheduling:

- Explanation: The system enables users to schedule and display appointments.
- Relevance: It helps healthcare institutions manage appointments effectively.
- Examples: Functions for scheduling and displaying appointments.

### Medical Record Management:

- Explanation: The system facilitates the addition and display of medical records for patients.
- Relevance: It ensures that healthcare providers can keep track of a patient's medical history.
- Examples: Functions for adding and displaying medical records.

# Discussion:

The Hospital Management System effectively achieves its goals through C++ object-oriented programming. It ensures structured patient data management, appointment scheduling, and medical record handling. Data storage and retrieval challenges are efficiently resolved.

The user-friendly interface promotes staff engagement with the system. Robust security via user authentication restricts unauthorized data access. The system offers scalability for small to medium-sized healthcare institutions, accommodating up to 1000 patients.

# Conclusion:

The Hospital Management System is a robust and secure solution for healthcare data management. It streamlines patient data, appointment management, and medical records. Employing C++ and object-oriented principles ensures a reliable and user-friendly system.

The successful implementation underscores its potential to enhance healthcare management and patient care.
